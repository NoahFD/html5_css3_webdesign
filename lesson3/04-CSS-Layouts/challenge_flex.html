            <p class="post-paragraph">Most AJ1s sport the Wings logo on the collar. But these aren't most AJ1s. These were the prototype for the icon. Go all the way back to MJ's first photo shoot. The playground. The photo. The kicks rocked over the shoulder. Notice anything different? Yeah, the collar has "Air Jordan" on it, not the Wings logo. And MJ signing all those autographs for the kids? He actually signed "My very best" along with his signature. That same message—in MJ's handwriting—is featured on the collar of the left shoe. But you're going to have to trust us. Unless you have a UV light. Then you can see it. But you'll always know. And when you know, you know.</p>
